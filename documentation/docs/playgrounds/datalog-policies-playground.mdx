# Datalog policies playground

![Otoroshi Biscuit Studio Datalog policies playground](/img/datalog-policies-playground.svg)]

The **Datalog Policies Playground** allows users to create and experiment with **Datalog** rules and policies for decentralized decision-making. It enables you to write and evaluate rules in a Datalog language, which is a declarative logic programming language used for expressing relations and rules.

Weâ€™ve developed a graphical tool within the Datalog Policies Playground to simplify the process of testing and experimenting with Datalog rules and policies.

This tool is an user-friendly interface that allows you to easily create, modify, and evaluate Datalog rules.

Also, the tool provides a visual environment where you can define rules in the Datalog language a declarative logic programming language designed for expressing relations and conditions. 

By using our graphical interface, you can quickly see how changes to the rules affect the outcomes, facilitating faster iteration and testing of policies in a more intuitive way.
