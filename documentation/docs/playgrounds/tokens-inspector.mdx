# Tokens Inspector

## Overview

Our **Tokens Inspector Playground** included in the Otoroshi Biscuit Studio provides a graphical interface to interact with Eclipse Biscuit tokens.

This tool allows you to generate tokens from a [forge entity](/docs/entities/forges), inspect existing tokens, and authorize them using manually set or entity-loaded facts.

## Features

### 1. Token Generation
- Generate a Biscuit token from a **forge entity**.

### 2. Token Inspection
- Load an existing **Biscuit token** to visualize its structure.
- Decode and display the tokenâ€™s **facts, rules, and checks** in a graphical format.

### 3. Authorization
- Load an **authorizer fact** from a [Verifier entity](/docs/entities/verifiers) or manually define it.
- Get a visual representation of the authorization result.

## How to Use
1. **Generating a Token**
   - Select the **Forge Entity** option.
   - Configure token parameters.
   - Generate and display the token.

2. **Inspecting a Token**
   - Upload or paste a Biscuit token.
   - View the decoded details, including facts, rules, and checks.

3. **Setting Up Authorization**
   - Load authorization facts from an entity or enter them manually.
   - Run authorization to check token validity.
   - View the decision result based on the provided facts.

## Use Cases
- Debugging and analyzing **Biscuit tokens**.
- Visualizing token structures for better understanding.
- Testing token authorization with various fact sets.
- Testing forge generation from an entity
- Testing facts loading from an authorizer entity
