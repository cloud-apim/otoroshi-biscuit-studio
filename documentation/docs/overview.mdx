# Overview

![Otoroshi Biscuit Studio](/img/undraw_features-overview_uone.svg)

[**Otoroshi Biscuit Studio**](https://github.com/cloud-apim/otoroshi-biscuit-studio) is a powerful extension for [Otoroshi](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/index.html), designed to integrate and manage [Biscuit Tokens](https://biscuitsec.org) seamlessly within your beloved API Gateway. 

Biscuit tokens offer a cutting-edge approach to secure and efficient access control. By combining advanced cryptographic techniques with a compact, extensible format, Biscuit tokens empower developers to create robust, scalable security solutions. 

Their versatility and unique features make them an ideal choice for modern token-based authentication and authorization systems, enabling fine-grained control over user access and permissions.

### Supported Entities in Otoroshi Biscuit Studio

* **[Biscuit KeyPairs](/docs/entities/keypairs)**  
  Create Biscuit Keypairs to generate and verify Biscuit tokens. 
  
  Keypairs are essential for signing and verifying tokens, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of requests.

* **[Biscuit Verifiers](/docs/entities/verifiers)**  
  Manage and configure verifiers that check the validity of incoming Biscuit tokens against defined rules and policies, ensuring proper authorization and security.

* **[Biscuit Attenuators](/docs/entities/attenuators)**  
  Configure attenuators to modify and return Biscuit tokens that have been "attenuated" (limited in scope or permissions), ensuring fine-grained control over access levels in your API routes.
  
* **[Biscuit RBAC Policies](/docs/entities/rbac)**  
  Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies using Biscuit tokens to enforce structured, flexible access control mechanisms within your application. This allows for secure, role-based user management.

* **[Biscuit Remote Facts Loader](/docs/entities/remotefacts)**  
  Integrate external data sources (remote facts) to enhance the authorization decisions made by Biscuit tokens, allowing dynamic and context-aware access control.

### Supported Plugins in Otoroshi Biscuit Studio

* **[Verifier plugin](/docs/plugins/verifiers)**  
  Integrate verifiers plugins into your Otoroshi routes to check the validity of Biscuit tokens. 
  
  This ensures that only authorized requests are processed, providing additional layers of security and control over your API traffic.

* **[Attenuator plugin](/docs/plugins/attenuators)**  
  Add attenuator plugins to your Otoroshi routes that apply attenuation to Biscuit tokens, allowing you to reduce or modify the scope of access granted by a token. 
  
  This can be used to tailor access permissions dynamically based on the specific needs of your routes or services.

* **[Client Credentials plugin](/docs/plugins/clientcredentials)**

  The Client Credentials Plugin is a `Backend` plugin that enables the OAuth2 `client_credentials` flow, using a [Biscuit Token](/docs/introduction) as the `access_token`.

* **[Biscuit User Extractor plugin](/docs/plugins/biscuit-user-extractor)**

  The Biscuit User Extractor plugin allows extracting user information from a Biscuit token and passing it along with the request to backend services.This helps identify users and enforce user-specific policies without additional authentication mechanisms.

* **[User to Biscuit Extractor plugin](/docs/plugins/user-to-biscuit)**

  This plugin will allow you to forge a Biscuit Token using the authenticated user from the request context. The biscuit token will be added into headers.

* **[ApiKey Bridge Plugin](/docs/plugins/apikeybridge)**

  The Biscuit API Key Bridge Plugin will extract an API key from the request.
