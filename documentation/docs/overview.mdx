# Overview

![Otoroshi Biscuit Studio](/img/undraw_features-overview_uone.svg)

[**Otoroshi Biscuit Studio**](https://github.com/cloud-apim/otoroshi-biscuit-studio) is a powerful extension for [Otoroshi](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/index.html), designed to integrate and manage [Eclipse Biscuit Tokens](https://biscuitsec.org) seamlessly within your beloved API Gateway. 

Biscuit tokens offer a cutting-edge approach to secure and efficient access control. By combining advanced cryptographic techniques with a compact, extensible format, **Eclipse Biscuit tokens** empower developers to create robust, scalable security solutions. 

Their versatility and unique features make them an ideal choice for modern token-based authentication and authorization systems, enabling fine-grained control over user access and permissions.

### Supported Entities in Otoroshi Biscuit Studio

* **[KeyPairs](/docs/entities/keypairs)**  
  Create Biscuit Keypairs to forge, attenuate and verify tokens. 
  
  Keypairs are essential for signing and verifying tokens, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of requests.

* **[Forges](/docs/entities/forges)**  
  Define a Forge to generate some tokens based on the facts and rules you provided in the forge configuration.

  It's kind a template to generate some tokens with given data. 
  
* **[Verifiers](/docs/entities/verifiers)**  
  Manage and configure verifiers that check the validity of incoming Eclipse Biscuit tokens against defined rules and policies, ensuring proper authorization and security.

* **[Attenuators](/docs/entities/attenuators)**  
  Configure attenuators to modify and return Biscuit tokens that have been "attenuated" (limited in scope or permissions), ensuring fine-grained control over access levels in your API routes.
  
* **[RBAC Policies](/docs/entities/rbac)**  
  Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies using Eclipse Biscuit tokens to enforce structured, flexible access control mechanisms within your application. This allows for secure, role-based user management.

* **[Remote Facts Loader](/docs/entities/remotefacts)**  
  Integrate external data sources (remote facts) to enhance the authorization decisions made by tokens, allowing dynamic and context-aware access control.

### Supported Plugins in Otoroshi Biscuit Studio

* **[Verifier](/docs/plugins/verifiers)**  
  Integrate verifiers plugins into your Otoroshi routes to check the validity of a provided token. 
  
  This ensures that only authorized tokens are accessing to the route, providing additional layers of security and control over your API traffic.

* **[Attenuator](/docs/plugins/attenuators)**  
  Add attenuator plugins to your Otoroshi routes that apply attenuation to a token, allowing you to reduce or modify the scope of access granted by a token. 
  
  This can be used to tailor access permissions dynamically based on the specific needs of your routes or services.

* **[Client Credentials](/docs/plugins/clientcredentials)**

  The Client Credentials Plugin is a `Backend` plugin that enables the OAuth2 `client_credentials` flow, using an [Eclipse Biscuit Token](/docs/introduction) as the `access_token`.

* **[Biscuit User Extractor](/docs/plugins/biscuit-user-extractor)**

  The Biscuit User Extractor plugin allows extracting user information from an Eclipse Biscuit token and passing it along with the request to backend services.This helps identify users and enforce user-specific policies without additional authentication mechanisms.

* **[User to Biscuit Extractor](/docs/plugins/user-to-biscuit)**

  This plugin will allow you to forge an Eclipse Biscuit Token using the authenticated user from the request context. The token will be added into headers.

* **[ApiKey Bridge](/docs/plugins/apikeybridge)**

  The Biscuit API Key Bridge Plugin will extract an API key from the request.
