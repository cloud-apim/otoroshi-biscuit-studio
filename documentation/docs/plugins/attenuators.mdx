# Attenuator plugin

When attenuating a Biscuit token from sources such as headers, cookies, or query parameters, the process begins by extracting and validating the original token. 

After validation, a new block is appended to enforce additional restrictions, such as limiting time, access rights, or endpoints.

Once the token is attenuated, the request can be "cleaned" by removing the original token from its initial location. 

The newly attenuated token can then be injected into the desired location, whether headers, cookies, or query parameters. 

This approach ensures secure, context-aware token usage while maintaining flexibility across various layers of your application.

## Attenuator Plugin configuration

Here is a demo configuration :

```js
  {
    "ref": "YOUR_BISCUIT_ATTENUATOR_REF",
    "extractor_type": "header", // header, query or cookies
    "extractor_name": "Authorization",
    "token_replace_loc": "query", // header, query or cookies
    "token_replace_name": "auth"
  }
```

## Example 

### **Request Before Attenuation**

#### **Original Request (Token in Header)**
```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Biscuit BISCUIT_TOKEN...originalTokenData
```

---

### **Process of Attenuation**
1. **Extract Token**: The `Authorization` header contains the original Biscuit token.
2. **Append Restrictions**: Add a new block to the token, restricting it (e.g., limit to `GET /api/resource` and expire in 30 minutes).
3. **Generate New Token**: The new attenuated Biscuit token is created.

---

### **Request After Attenuation**

#### **Attenuated Request (Token in Query Parameter)**
```http
GET /api/resource?auth=biscuit:NEW_ATTENUATED_BISCUIT_TOKEN...attenuatedTokenData HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Alternatively:

#### **Attenuated Request (Token in Cookie)**
```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Cookie: auth=biscuit:NEW_ATTENUATED_BISCUIT_TOKEN...attenuatedTokenData
```

---

### **Explanation of Changes**
- **Original Location**: The token was in the `Authorization` header.
- **New Location**: The attenuated token was moved to either the query parameter (`auth`) or a cookie.
- **Token Content**: The attenuated token now includes additional constraints, such as time-bound access or endpoint-specific restrictions. 

This flexibility allows secure propagation of tokens while adapting to different application needs.
