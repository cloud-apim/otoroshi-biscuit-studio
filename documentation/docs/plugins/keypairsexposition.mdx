# Exposing Biscuit Public Keys


Biscuit tokens rely on public key cryptography for secure, decentralized authorization. To enable verification, public keys need to be exposed to services that will validate Biscuit tokens.

This guide explains how to configure public key exposition in an Otoroshi environment using the Biscuit extension.

## Introduction

To expose your Biscuit public keys, you need to create a dedicated endpoint in your API gateway. 

You can use the recommended URL for this exposition :

```
/.well-known/biscuit-web-keys
```

This endpoint will serve the list of public keys that can be used to verify Biscuit tokens issued by your system.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create one Biscuit KeyPair**
 - Go to the **Biscuit keypairs** section in the Otoroshi Admin UI.

You can follow [this guide](/docs/entities/keypairs) to help you to create your first Biscuit Keypair.

2. **Create a Route in Otoroshi**:
   - Go to the **Routes** section in the Otoroshi Admin UI.
   - Add a new route with the path `/.well-known/biscuit-web-keys`.

3. **Enable Public Key Exposition**:
   - Add the `Cloud APIM - Expose Biscuit public keys`plugin to your route.

## Plugin configuration

Public keys are selected for exposition based on the following rules:

1. **Defining Authorized Public Keys** (Optional):  
   - You can explicitly list authorized public keys in the configuration.
   - Only the keys in this list will be exposed.

2. **Leaving the Authorized List Blank**:  
   - If you do not specify an authorized keys list, **all keys** can be exposed.
   - However, each key **must** have the **"Expose this public key"** flag enabled to be included.

## How Public Keys Are Exposed

Once configured, Otoroshi will expose public keys in JSON format at the `/.well-known/biscuit-web-keys` endpoint. 

Any client or service that needs to verify Biscuit tokens can retrieve the list of valid public keys from this endpoint.

## Example Public Key Exposition Output

When configured correctly, the system will expose public keys in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "algorithm": "ed25519",
      "key_bytes": "B8453EA97EAF3D6A24FCC63D1317225BE9AAB1ABF26FBEFE8A34FE5BF39BFA00",
      "key_id": "biscuit-keypair_6a3a5de9-b2ef-4bae-9422-9d644ec3b419",
      "issuer": "Otoroshi"
    },
    {
      "algorithm": "ed25519",
      "key_bytes": "294DC8ED8EF8C491DC9632EDDD827F81384325A6C6DEFBC643F6EBCF41D155BA",
      "key_id": "biscuit-keypair_82167e67-e820-402f-a564-c4cd1b35832f",
      "issuer": "Otoroshi"
    }
  ]
}
```
