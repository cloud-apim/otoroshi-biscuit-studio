# Introduction

![](/img/undraw_presentation.svg)

Biscuit tokens bring a new level of security and adaptability to token-based systems. By leveraging cryptographic primitives and a unique capability-based design, they enable:

- **Granular Control**: Fine-tuned permissions for secure operations.
- **Extensibility**: Support for custom logic through policies and external data.
- **Efficiency**: Compact structure ensures seamless transmission and storage.

### Why Use Biscuit Tokens?

- **Flexibility**: Tailor tokens to specific scenarios with attenuation and delegation.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small-scale applications and large distributed systems.
- **Transparency**: Built-in auditable policies ensure clear and accountable access control.

By adopting Biscuit tokens, developers can create robust access control systems that are secure, efficient, and adaptable to various use cases.
