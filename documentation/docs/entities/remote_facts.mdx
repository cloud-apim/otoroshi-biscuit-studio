# Remote Facts Loader

The **Remote Facts Loader** entity facilitates the loading of external facts provided by an API. This entity is particularly useful for dynamic role and permission management based on external data sources.

---

## Overview
The Remote Facts Loader connects to an API endpoint to fetch data, such as roles and their associated permissions, and integrates it into your system. This entity is configured with metadata and API details to ensure smooth interaction.

## API Input Example
Below is an example of the data structure that your API might return. This JSON array defines roles and their associated permissions:

```json
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "admin": ["billing:read", "billing:write", "address:read", "address:write"]
    },
    {
      "accounting": ["billing:read", "billing:write", "address:read"]
    },
    {
      "support": ["address:read", "address:write"]
    },
    {
      "pilot":  ["spaceship:drive", "address:read"]
    },
    {
      "delivery":  ["address:read", "package:load", "package:unload", "package:deliver"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Fields in the JSON:
- **roles**: An array of objects, each representing a role.
- Each role object contains a key-value pair where the key is the role name (e.g., `admin`) and the value is an array of permissions associated with the role.
