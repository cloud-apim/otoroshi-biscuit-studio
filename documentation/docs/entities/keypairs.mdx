# KeyPairs

Biscuit Auth tokens are flexible, decentralized, and cryptographically secure authorization tokens. 

They use ED25519 keypairs for digital signature generation and verification, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

Each token is signed with a private ED25519 key and can be verified using the corresponding public key. 

This cryptographic mechanism guarantees that tokens cannot be tampered with or forged.

## Example Keypair:

### Private Key:
This is a 64-byte (or 128-character hexadecimal) key combining a seed and an expanded key.

### Public Key:
The public key is derived from the private key and is 32 bytes (64-character hexadecimal).
