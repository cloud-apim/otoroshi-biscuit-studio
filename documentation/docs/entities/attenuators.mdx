# Attenuators

## What biscuit attenuators are ?

One of Biscuit's core strengths is its ability to attenuate tokens by appending blocks with specific checks, effectively restricting their scope of use. 

This allows developers to tailor token permissions to suit different use cases.

See [this article](/docs/plugins/attenuators) to integrate your attenuator entity to your route's plugins.
